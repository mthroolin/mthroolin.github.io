I am a PhD student studying biostatistics at the University of Utah. My research interests include high-dimensional data analysis and visualization, Bayesian inference, causal inference, and mathematical statistics. Outside of my studies, I am an ultramarathoner and mountaineer.

My parents ensured that my siblings and I had strong foundations in mathematics. This led me to begin studies in pure mathematics at the University of Washington, where I particularly became fond of discrete mathematical modeling and was introduced to graph theory and Markov chains. I received a recruitment scholarship to finish my degree at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, where I continued independent research in graph theory. While in Hawaii, a friend and I presented some research in physical probability at an undergraduate symposium.

After graduating, I wanted to inspire younger generations to pursue an education in the mathematical sciences, so I got a job as a TA fora math course at Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth for a summer. Then I moved back to Washington, where I volunteered as a math coach for homeschool students who wanted to start a math club. As the lead for the development of activities at that club, I taught introductory topology, game theory, combinatorics, and other advanced mathematical topics and gave the club members classic problems in each field to solve. After the math club season was over, I decided to serve a mission for my church and resigned from my position as a coach. The next year, under the leadership of my sister, that team competed in the Washington State Math Olympiad, and several of the students placed in the top ten for individual and team competitions, coming home decorated with medals.

My service as a church missionary in Portugal was integral to focusing my career path towards biostatistics. Several people I met had me tutor their kids in mathematics, and I developed a bilingual mathematical vocabulary. I talked with many mathematicians studying at the University of Porto. Later, I served in the city of Ã‰vora and worked through some mathematical statistics problems with a coupl of the graduate students attending the university there. The experiences I had in Portugal led me to want to pursue a graduate education in statistics when I returned to the United States, so I purchased a textbook in mathematical statistics and began self-studying to prepare for my education.

I have since earned a master's degree in statistics at Montana State University, where I wrote an unpublished brief introduction to directed acyclic graphs and Markov equivalence in a causal inference framework. There, I was funded as a teaching assistant but also did some consulting with a researcher working with livestock. Results from our collaboration in livestock health research have been presented at multiple conferences and will soon be published.

Now, as I prepare to write a dissertation in biostatistics, I am funded as a research assistant in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the University of Utah.
